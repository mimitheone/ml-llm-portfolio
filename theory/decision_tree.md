# Decision Tree Classifier Theory

## Overview
Decision Trees are tree-like models that make decisions based on asking a series of questions about the input features, making them highly interpretable and suitable for credit risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer segmentation in banking.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Tree Structure
A decision tree consists of:
- **Root Node**: Starting point with all data
- **Internal Nodes**: Decision points with splitting criteria
- **Leaf Nodes**: Final predictions (class labels or probabilities)

### Splitting Criteria
**Gini Impurity**:
```
Gini = 1 - Σ(p_i²)
```

**Entropy**:
```
Entropy = -Σ(p_i * log₂(p_i))
```

**Information Gain**:
```
IG = Entropy(parent) - Σ(|S_v|/|S| * Entropy(S_v))
```

## Banking Applications

### 1. Credit Risk Assessment
- **Default Prediction**: Tree-based credit scoring models
- **Risk Segmentation**: Hierarchical risk classification
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Explainable risk decisions

### 2. Fraud Detection
- **Transaction Classification**: Rule-based fraud detection
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify suspicious behavior patterns
- **Real-time Scoring**: Fast inference for transaction monitoring

### 3. Customer Segmentation
- **Behavioral Clustering**: Group customers by behavior patterns
- **Product Recommendations**: Match products to customer profiles
- **Churn Prediction**: Identify at-risk customers

## Implementation Considerations

### Tree Construction
- **Maximum Depth**: Control tree complexity
- **Minimum Samples Split**: Minimum samples required to split

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Use explainable features

### Pruning
- **Cost Complexity Pruning**: Balance accuracy vs. complexity
- **Minimum Impurity Decrease**: Stop splitting when improvement is minimal
- **Cross-Validation**: Use CV to determine optimal pruning

## Evaluation Metrics

### Classification Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
