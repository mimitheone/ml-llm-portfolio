# Lasso Regression Theory

## Overview
Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression is a regularization technique that adds an L1 penalty term to perform both regularization and feature selection, making it particularly valuable for high-dimensional financial datasets.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Cost Function
The Lasso Regression cost function is:

```
J(θ) = (1/2m) * Σ(h_θ(x^(i)) - y^(i))² + λ * Σ|θ_j|
```

Where:
- `λ` (lambda) is the regularization parameter
- `|θ_j|` represents the absolute value of weights
- The L1 penalty creates sparse solutions with exact zero coefficients

### Solution Properties
- **Sparsity**: Many coefficients become exactly zero
- **Feature Selection**: Automatic selection of relevant features
- **Interpretability**: Clear feature importance ranking

## Banking Applications

### 1. Credit Risk Modeling
- **Feature Selection**: Identify key risk drivers from hundreds of variables
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Focus on most important risk factors
- **Model Simplification**: Reduce complexity for validation teams

### 2. Fraud Detection
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Select critical fraud indicators
- **Real-time Scoring**: Fast inference with reduced feature set
- **Alert Prioritization**: Focus on most predictive signals

### 3. Portfolio Management
- **Asset Selection**: Choose optimal asset combinations
- **Risk Factor Modeling**: Identify key market risk drivers
- **Performance Attribution**: Understand return drivers

## Implementation Considerations

### Feature Engineering
- **Domain Knowledge**: Incorporate business expertise
- **Feature Interactions**: Create meaningful combinations
- **Temporal Features**: Handle time-dependent patterns

### Hyperparameter Selection
- **λ Range**: Test from 0.001 to 1000
- **Cross-Validation**: Use stratified CV for financial data
- **Business Constraints**: Balance sparsity vs. performance

### Feature Scaling
- **Standardization**: Essential for L1 regularization
- **Robust Scaling**: Handle outliers appropriately
- **Consistency**: Maintain scaling across environments

## Evaluation Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- **R² Score**: Overall model fit
- **RMSE**: Prediction accuracy
- **MAE**: Robust error measure
- **Feature Count**: Number of selected features

### Stability Metrics
- **Feature Consistency**: Stability of selected features
- **Coefficient Stability**: Parameter consistency across CV folds
- **Prediction Variance**: Stability of predictions

## Best Practices

### Data Quality
- **Missing Values**: Handle appropriately before Lasso
- **Outliers**: Use robust scaling methods
- **Multicollinearity**: Lasso handles this automatically

### Model Validation
- **Time-Series CV**: Respect temporal order in financial data
- **Out-of-Sample Testing**: Validate on future periods
- **Business Validation**: Ensure selected features make sense

### Feature Interpretation
- **Coefficient Signs**: Validate against business logic
- **Feature Importance**: Rank by absolute coefficient values
- **Domain Validation**: Confirm with subject matter experts

## Regulatory Compliance

### Model Governance
- **Feature Documentation**: Clear rationale for selected features
- **Validation Process**: Independent review of feature selection
- **Monitoring**: Track feature stability over time

### Risk Management
- **Stress Testing**: Model behavior with different feature sets
- **Scenario Analysis**: Impact of feature availability changes
- **Backtesting**: Historical performance validation

## Advanced Techniques

### Elastic Net
- **Combined Penalties**: L1 + L2 regularization
- **Feature Selection**: Maintains sparsity benefits
- **Stability**: Better than pure Lasso for correlated features

### Group Lasso
- **Structured Sparsity**: Select groups of related features
