# Linear Regression

## Overview
Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in Machine Learning.  
It tries to describe how one **dependent variable** (the target) changes when one or more **independent variables** (the inputs/features) change.

- **y** ‚Üí the **dependent variable**, also called the target.  
  In banking: this could be the **monthly loan payment**, **customer deposit amount**, or **default risk score**.  
- **x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô** ‚Üí the **independent variables**, also called predictors or features.  
  In banking: this could include **income, age, loan amount, credit score, years with the bank**, etc.  

The model equation is:

```
y = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ + ... + Œ≤‚Çôx‚Çô + Œµ
```

- **Œ≤‚ÇÄ** ‚Üí intercept (baseline prediction when all features are zero)  
- **Œ≤·µ¢** ‚Üí coefficients showing the strength and direction of influence of each feature  
- **Œµ** ‚Üí error term (the part of y that the model cannot explain)  

üéØ **What the model is trying to do:**  
Find the values of the coefficients (Œ≤) so that the predictions ≈∑ are as close as possible to the actual values of y.  
This is done by minimizing the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:

```
MSE = (1/n) √ó Œ£(y·µ¢ - ≈∑·µ¢)¬≤
```

In simple words:  
> Linear Regression tries to draw the "best possible line (or plane)" through the data points, so that the difference between predicted and actual values is as small as possible.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Simple Linear Regression
For a single feature:
```
y = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅx + Œµ
```

Where:
- **y** = target variable (dependent variable)
- **x** = feature (independent variable)
- **Œ≤‚ÇÄ** = y-intercept (bias term)
- **Œ≤‚ÇÅ** = slope (coefficient)
- **Œµ** = error term

### Multiple Linear Regression
For multiple features:
```
y = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ + ... + Œ≤‚Çôx‚Çô + Œµ
```

## Cost Function
Mean Squared Error (MSE):
```
J(Œ≤) = (1/2m) √ó Œ£(h(x‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ) - y‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ)¬≤
```

Where:
- **m** = number of training examples
- **h(x‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ)** = predicted value
- **y‚ÅΩ‚Å±‚Åæ** = actual value

## Optimization
**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: Minimizes the sum of squared residuals by solving the normal equation:
```
Œ≤ = (X·µÄX)‚Åª¬πX·µÄy
```

## Implementation with Scikit-Learn

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample banking dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "Income": [3000,4500,6000,2000,7000,3500,5000,4000,6500,2500],
    "Age": [25,40,35,30,50,28,45,32,38,27],
    "LoanAmount": [10000,15000,20000,5000,25000,12000,18000,14000,22000,8000],
    "CreditScore": [650,700,720,600,750,680,710,690,730,640],
    "MonthlyPayment": [1200,1500,2100,800,2400,1300,1800,1400,2200,1000]
})

# Features (X) and target (y)
X = data[["Income","Age","LoanAmount","CreditScore"]]
y = data["MonthlyPayment"]

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Results
print("Intercept (Œ≤0):", model.intercept_)
print("Coefficients (Œ≤1..Œ≤n):", model.coef_)

# Make a prediction for a new client
new_client = [[5500, 33, 16000, 700]]
prediction = model.predict(new_client)
print("Predicted Monthly Payment:", prediction[0])
```

## Results Analysis

After training the model, we obtain:
- **Intercept (Œ≤‚ÇÄ)**: baseline monthly payment when all features are zero
- **Coefficients (Œ≤‚ÇÅ..Œ≤‚Çô)**: impact of each variable on the monthly payment

### Example Output
```
Intercept (Œ≤0): 250.5
Coefficients (Œ≤1..Œ≤n): [0.28, 1.5, -0.04, 0.85]
```

### Interpretation
- **Income (0.28)** ‚Üí For every additional 1000 in income, the monthly payment increases by ~280.
- **Age (1.5)** ‚Üí Older clients tend to have slightly higher payments (correlated with bigger loans).
- **LoanAmount (-0.04)** ‚Üí Negative coefficient: larger loans are often spread over more months, lowering the monthly payment.
- **CreditScore (0.85)** ‚Üí Higher credit score ‚Üí higher predicted payment (these clients qualify for bigger loans).
- **Intercept (250.5)** ‚Üí This is the "baseline" monthly payment when all features are zero. Not directly interpretable, but required mathematically.

### Example Prediction
```python
new_client = [[5500, 33, 16000, 700]]
prediction = model.predict(new_client)
print("Predicted Monthly Payment:", prediction[0])
```

**Output:**
```
Predicted Monthly Payment: ~1750
```

**Interpretation:**
A 33-year-old client with income 5500, a 16,000 loan, and credit score 700 is expected to have a monthly payment of about 1750.

## Next Steps
- Use **R¬≤ score** to measure model performance (explained variance).
- Apply **Ridge** or **Lasso Regression** to handle multicollinearity and prevent overfitting.
- Train on larger datasets (e.g., **UCI Bank Marketing Dataset**).
- Visualize predictions vs. actual values to check accuracy.

## Assumptions
1. **Linearity**: Relationship between features and target is linear
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent
3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of residuals
4. **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed
5. **No Multicollinearity**: Features are not highly correlated

## Advantages
- ‚úÖ Simple and interpretable
- ‚úÖ Fast training and prediction
- ‚úÖ Provides coefficient importance
- ‚úÖ Works well with small datasets

## Limitations
- ‚ùå Assumes linear relationships
- ‚ùå Sensitive to outliers
- ‚ùå Cannot capture complex patterns
- ‚ùå Requires feature scaling

## Implementation in Banking
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Scale features for better performance
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_scaled, y)

# Get coefficients (feature importance)
coefficients = model.coef_
feature_importance = dict(zip(feature_names, coefficients))
```

## Model Evaluation
- **R¬≤ Score**: Proportion of variance explained
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Standard deviation of residuals
- **Residual Analysis**: Check assumptions

## Best Practices
1. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers
3. **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation
4. **Regularization**: Consider Ridge/Lasso for overfitting
5. **Interpretability**: Explain coefficients to stakeholders

## Regulatory Considerations
- **EU AI Act**: Low-risk classification for simple models
- **Basel III**: Risk model validation requirements
- **GDPR**: Explainable AI requirements
- **Model Governance**: Document assumptions and limitations
